This is a basic Phone using <a href="https://github.com/project-error/fivem-react-boilerplate-lua">React and Lua Boilerplate</a> for getting started
with React in NUI. It is for both browser
and in-game based development workflows.

For in-game workflows, Utilizing `craco` to override CRA, we can have hot
builds that require a resource restart instead of a full
production build

the version of the <a href="https://github.com/project-error/fivem-react-boilerplate-lua">boilerplate</a> I used is meant for the CfxLua runtime.
